Closures are functions that retain access to the variables in their enclosing scope even after the outer function has completed execution.

This inner function can still remember and use variables from the main function, even after the main function has finished running. It's like the inner function carries around a piece of the main function's memory. This unique behavior allows you to create special functions that \"remember\" certain things from the past, and one common use of this is in creating decorators in Python. Decorators are functions that can modify the behavior of other functions in a flexible and convenient way.

Similarly, calling `multiplier(3)` gives us a `triple` function that multiplies its argument by 3. This demonstrates how nested functions can create reusable, encapsulated components, enhancing code modularity and readability.\n","\n","In summary, nested functions in Python provide a versatile tool for creating well-structured, modular code.
