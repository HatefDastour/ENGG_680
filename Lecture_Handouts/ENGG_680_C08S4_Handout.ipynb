This is done by applying a mathematical operation called convolution between the image $I$ and a specific pattern called the \"kernel.\" The kernel used for horizontal changes is denoted as $G_x$. When we have a 3x3 kernel, it looks like this:\n","\n","   \\begin{equation} G_x = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & +1 \\\\ -2 & 0 & +2 \\\\ -1 & 0 & +1 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}\n","\n","   - In parallel, we also want to know how the image changes vertically (from top to bottom).

Canny [Canny, 1986].

This step aims to enhance the overall quality of the image by reducing noise artifacts [OpenCV Developers, 2023].\n","\n","2. **Intensity Gradient Calculation**: Following noise reduction, the smoothened image undergoes gradient calculations in both horizontal ($G_x$) and vertical ($G_y$) directions. These gradients are used to determine the edge gradient magnitude ($G$) and direction ($\\theta$) for each pixel [OpenCV Developers, 2023]:\n","\n","   \\begin{align}\n","   G &= \\sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}\\\\\n","   \\theta &= \\tan^{-1} \\left(\\frac{G_y}{G_x}\\right)\n","   \\end{align}\n","\n","   It's essential to note that the gradient direction is always perpendicular to the edges and is quantized to one of four angles, representing vertical, horizontal, and two diagonal directions [OpenCV Developers, 2023].\n","\n","3. **Non-maximum Suppression**: In this stage, a comprehensive scan of the image is conducted to eliminate extraneous pixels that do not constitute edges. For each pixel, a check is performed to ascertain if it is a local maximum within its neighborhood along the gradient direction. If a pixel qualifies as a local maximum, it is retained for subsequent stages; otherwise, it is suppressed (set to zero) [OpenCV Developers, 2023].\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HatefDastour/hatefdastour.github.io/master/_notes/Introduction_to_Digital_Engineering/_images/nms.jpg\" alt=\"picture\" width=\"700\">\n","</center>\n","\n","\n","Point A resides on the edge in the vertical direction, and the gradient direction aligns perpendicularly to this edge. Points B and C lie along the gradient directions. Point A is subject to evaluation by comparing it to points B and C to determine if it qualifies as a local maximum. If it meets this criterion, it proceeds to the subsequent stage of processing; otherwise, it undergoes suppression and is assigned a value of zero.

It relies on two threshold values, namely, minVal and maxVal. Pixels with intensity gradients exceeding maxVal are unequivocally identified as edges, while those falling below minVal are unequivocally classified as non-edges and discarded. Pixels falling between these two thresholds are assessed based on their connectivity to \"sure-edge\" pixels. If they are connected to such pixels, they are deemed part of the edges; otherwise, they are also discarded [OpenCV Developers, 2023].\n","\n","\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HatefDastour/hatefdastour.github.io/master/_notes/Introduction_to_Digital_Engineering/_images/hysteresis.jpg\" alt=\"picture\" width=\"500\">\n","</center>\n","\n","\n","Edge A surpasses the threshold maxVal, categorizing it as a \"sure-edge.\" Conversely, while edge C falls below maxVal, its connectivity to edge A validates it as a legitimate edge, resulting in the formation of the complete curve.

Consequently, the precise selection of minVal and maxVal is of paramount importance in achieving accurate results.
