This is particularly useful when you need to ensure your plot fits well within your document or presentation.\n","\n","2. **Adding Titles and Labels:**\n","   Titles and labels provide context to your plot. Use `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, and `plt.ylabel()` to add a title and label the axes, respectively.\n","\n","3. **Setting Axis Limits:**\n","   Adjust the visible range of your data on the x and y axes using `plt.xlim()` and `plt.ylim()`.\n","\n","4. **Adding Gridlines:**\n","   Gridlines can aid in understanding data relationships. Enable them using `plt.grid(True)`.\n","\n","5. **Changing Line Styles and Markers:**\n","   You can customize the appearance of lines and markers using options like `linestyle` and `marker` when using functions like `plt.plot()`.\n","\n","6. **Changing Colors:**\n","   Customize colors using options like `color` or specifying color codes. You can use named colors ('blue', 'red', etc.) or hexadecimal color codes.\n","\n","7. **Adding Legends:**\n","   If you have multiple datasets, add a legend to differentiate them. Use `plt.legend()` and provide labels for each dataset.\n","\n","8. **Adjusting Tick Labels:**\n","   Customize tick labels on axes using functions like `plt.xticks()` and `plt.yticks()`. You can provide custom tick positions and labels.\n","\n","9. **Adding Annotations and Text:**\n","   You can annotate points on the plot or add text explanations using functions like `plt.annotate()` and `plt.text()`.\n","\n","10. **Changing Background and Grid Style:**\n","    Change the appearance of the plot background and gridlines using styles like 'dark_background' or 'whitegrid'. Use `plt.style.use()` to apply the desired style.\n","\n","11. **Creating Subplots:**\n","    Use `plt.subplots()` to create multiple plots in a grid.
